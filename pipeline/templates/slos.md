## Error Budget Policy

1. **Budget period:** 30 days, reset monthly.
2. **Exhaustion triggers:**
   - 50% exhausted → page on-call; prioritize reliability work.
   - 100% exhausted → feature freeze until budget resets or SLO is restored.
3. **Exceptions:** security incidents and force-majeure events do not consume error budget.

## On-Call & Escalation

| Severity | Criteria | Response time | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEV1 | Complete outage or data loss | 15 minutes | Page engineering + product |
| SEV2 | Major feature degraded | 1 hour | Page engineering |
| SEV3 | Minor degradation | 4 hours | Next business day |
| SEV4 | Cosmetic / low impact | Best effort | Backlog |
